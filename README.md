## Signal Intelligence

The dashboard continuously analyzes data streams to detect significant patterns and anomalies. Signals appear in the header badge (⚡) with confidence scores.

### Signal Types

| Signal | Trigger | What It Means |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **◉ Convergence** | 3+ source types report same story within 30 minutes | Multiple independent channels confirming the same event—higher likelihood of significance |
| **△ Triangulation** | Wire + Government + Intel sources align | The "authority triangle"—when official channels, wire services, and defense specialists all report the same thing |
| **🔥 Velocity Spike** | Topic mention rate doubles with 6+ sources/hour | A story is accelerating rapidly across the news ecosystem |
| **🔮 Prediction Leading** | Prediction market moves 5%+ with low news coverage | Markets pricing in information not yet reflected in news |
| **📊 Silent Divergence** | Market moves 2%+ with minimal related news | Unexplained price action—possible insider knowledge or algorithm-driven |

### How It Works

The correlation engine maintains rolling snapshots of:
- News topic frequency (by keyword extraction)
- Market price changes
- Prediction market probabilities

Each refresh cycle compares current state to previous snapshot, applying thresholds and deduplication to avoid alert fatigue. Signals include confidence scores (60-95%) based on the strength of the pattern.

---

## Source Intelligence

Not all sources are equal. The system implements a dual classification to prioritize authoritative information.

### Source Tiers (Authority Ranking)

| Tier | Sources | Characteristics |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Tier 1** | Reuters, AP, AFP, Bloomberg, White House, Pentagon | Wire services and official government—fastest, most reliable |
| **Tier 2** | BBC, Guardian, NPR, Al Jazeera, CNBC, Financial Times | Major outlets—high editorial standards, some latency |
| **Tier 3** | Defense One, Bellingcat, Foreign Policy, MIT Tech Review | Domain specialists—deep expertise, narrower scope |
| **Tier 4** | Hacker News, The Verge, VentureBeat, aggregators | Useful signal but requires corroboration |

When multiple sources report the same story, the **lowest tier** (most authoritative) source is displayed as the primary, with others listed as corroborating.

### Source Types (Categorical)

Sources are also categorized by function for triangulation detection:

- **Wire** - News agencies (Reuters, AP, AFP, Bloomberg)
- **Gov** - Official government (White House, Pentagon, State Dept, Fed, SEC)
- **Intel** - Defense/security specialists (Defense One, Bellingcat, Krebs)
- **Mainstream** - Major news outlets (BBC, Guardian, NPR, Al Jazeera)
- **Market** - Financial press (CNBC, MarketWatch, Financial Times)
- **Tech** - Technology coverage (Hacker News, Ars Technica, MIT Tech Review)

---

## Algorithms & Design

### News Clustering

Related articles are grouped using **Jaccard similarity** on tokenized headlines:

```
similarity(A, B) = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|
```

- Headlines are tokenized, lowercased, and stripped of stop words
- Articles with similarity ≥ 0.5 are grouped into clusters
- Clusters are sorted by source tier, then recency
- The most authoritative source becomes the "primary" headline

### Velocity Analysis

Each news cluster tracks publication velocity:

- **Sources per hour** = article count / time span
- **Trend** = rising/stable/falling based on first-half vs second-half publication rate
- **Levels**: Normal (<3/hr), Elevated (3-6/hr), Spike (>6/hr)

### Sentiment Detection

Headlines are scored against curated word lists:

**Negative indicators**: war, attack, killed, crisis, crash, collapse, threat, sanctions, invasion, missile, terror, assassination, recession, layoffs...

**Positive indicators**: peace, deal, agreement, breakthrough, recovery, growth, ceasefire, treaty, alliance, victory...

Score determines sentiment classification: negative (<-1), neutral (-1 to +1), positive (>+1)

### Baseline Deviation (Z-Score)

The system maintains rolling baselines for news volume per topic:

- **7-day average** and **30-day average** stored in IndexedDB
- Standard deviation calculated from historical counts
- **Z-score** = (current - mean) / stddev

Deviation levels:
- **Spike**: Z > 2.5 (statistically rare increase)
- **Elevated**: Z > 1.5
- **Normal**: -2 < Z < 1.5
- **Quiet**: Z < -2 (unusually low activity)

This enables detection of anomalous activity even when absolute numbers seem normal.

---

## Dynamic Hotspot Activity

Hotspots on the map are **not static threat levels**. Activity is calculated in real-time based on news correlation.

Each hotspot defines keywords:
```typescript
{
  id: 'dc',
  name: 'DC',
  keywords: ['pentagon', 'white house', 'congress', 'cia', 'nsa', ...],
  agencies: ['Pentagon', 'CIA', 'NSA', 'State Dept'],
}
```

The system counts matching news articles in the current feed, applies velocity analysis, and assigns activity levels:

| Level | Criteria | Visual |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Low** | <3 matches, normal velocity | Gray marker |
| **Elevated** | 3-6 matches OR elevated velocity | Yellow pulse |
| **High** | >6 matches OR spike velocity | Red pulse |

This creates a dynamic "heat map" of global attention based on live news flow.

---

## Pentagon Pizza Index (PizzINT)

The dashboard integrates real-time foot traffic data from strategic locations near government and military facilities. This "Pizza Index" concept—tracking late-night activity spikes at restaurants near the Pentagon, Langley, and other facilities—provides an unconventional indicator of crisis activity.

### How It Works

The system aggregates percentage-of-usual metrics from monitored locations:

1. **Locations**: Fast food, pizza shops, and convenience stores near Pentagon, CIA, NSA, State Dept, and other facilities
2. **Aggregation**: Activity percentages are averaged, capped at 100%
3. **Spike Detection**: Locations exceeding their baseline are flagged

### DEFCON-Style Alerting

Aggregate activity maps to a 5-level readiness scale:

| Level | Threshold | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **DEFCON 1** | ≥90% | COCKED PISTOL | Maximum readiness; crisis response active |
| **DEFCON 2** | ≥75% | FAST PACE | High activity; significant event underway |
| **DEFCON 3** | ≥50% | ROUND HOUSE | Elevated; above-normal operations |
| **DEFCON 4** | ≥25% | DOUBLE TAKE | Increased vigilance |
| **DEFCON 5** | <25% | FADE OUT | Normal peacetime operations |

### GDELT Tension Pairs

The indicator also displays geopolitical tension scores from GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone):

| Pair | Monitored Relationship |
|------|----------------------|
| USA ↔ Russia | Primary nuclear peer adversary |
| USA ↔ China | Economic and military competition |
| USA ↔ Iran | Middle East regional tensions |
| Israel ↔ Iran | Direct conflict potential |
| China ↔ Taiwan | Cross-strait relations |
| Russia ↔ Ukraine | Active conflict zone |

Each pair shows:
- **Current tension score** (GDELT's normalized metric)
- **7-day trend** (rising, falling, stable)
- **Percentage change** from previous period

This provides context for the activity levels—a spike at Pentagon locations during a rising China-Taiwan tension score carries different weight than during a quiet period.

---

## Related Assets

News clusters are automatically enriched with nearby critical infrastructure. When a story mentions a geographic region, the system identifies relevant assets within 600km, providing immediate operational context.

### Asset Types

| Type | Source | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Pipelines** | 88 global routes | Nord Stream, Keystone, Trans-Siberian |
| **Undersea Cables** | 55 major cables | TAT-14, SEA-ME-WE, Pacific Crossing |
| **AI Datacenters** | 111 clusters (≥10k GPUs) | Azure East US, GCP Council Bluffs |
| **Military Bases** | 220+ installations | Ramstein, Diego Garcia, Guam |
| **Nuclear Facilities** | 100+ sites | Power plants, weapons labs, enrichment |

### Location Inference

The system infers the geographic focus of news stories through:

1. **Keyword matching**: Headlines are scanned against hotspot keyword lists (e.g., "Taiwan" → Taiwan Strait hotspot)
2. **Confidence scoring**: Multiple keyword matches increase location confidence
3. **Fallback to conflicts**: If no hotspot matches, active conflict zones are checked

### Distance Calculation

Assets are ranked by Haversine distance from the inferred location:

```
d = 2r × arcsin(√(sin²(Δφ/2) + cos(φ₁) × cos(φ₂) × sin²(Δλ/2)))
```

Up to 3 assets per type are displayed, sorted by proximity.

### Example Context

A news cluster about "pipeline explosion in Germany" would show:
- **Pipelines**: Nord Stream (23km), Yamal-Europe (156km)
- **Cables**: TAT-14 landing (89km)
- **Bases**: Ramstein (234km)

Clicking an asset zooms the map to its location and displays detailed information.

## Custom Monitors

Create personalized keyword alerts that scan all incoming news:

1. Enter comma-separated keywords (e.g., "nvidia, gpu, chip shortage")
2. System assigns a unique color
3. Matching articles are highlighted in the Monitor panel
4. Matching articles in clusters inherit the monitor color

Monitors persist across sessions via LocalStorage.

---

## Activity Tracking

The dashboard highlights newly-arrived items so you can quickly identify what changed since your last look.

### Visual Indicators

| Indicator | Duration | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **NEW tag** | 2 minutes | Badge on items that just appeared |
| **Glow highlight** | 30 seconds | Subtle animation drawing attention |
| **Panel badge** | Until viewed | Count of new items in collapsed panels |

### Automatic "Seen" Detection

The system uses IntersectionObserver to detect when panels become visible:

- When a panel is >50% visible for >500ms, items are marked as "seen"
- Scrolling through a panel marks visible items progressively
- Switching panels resets the "new" state appropriately

### Panel-Specific Tracking

Each panel maintains independent activity state:

- **News**: New clusters since last view
- **Markets**: Price changes exceeding thresholds
- **Predictions**: Probability shifts >5%
- **Earthquakes**: New seismic events

This enables focused monitoring—you can collapse panels you've reviewed and see at a glance which have new activity.

---

## Snapshot System

The dashboard captures periodic snapshots for historical analysis:

- **Automatic capture** every refresh cycle
- **7-day retention** with automatic cleanup
- **Stored data**: news clusters, market prices, prediction values, hotspot levels
- **Playback**: Load historical snapshots to see past dashboard states

Baselines (7-day and 30-day averages) are stored in IndexedDB for deviation analysis.

---

## Maritime Intelligence

The Ships layer provides real-time vessel tracking and maritime domain awareness through AIS (Automatic Identification System) data.

### Chokepoint Monitoring

The system monitors eight critical maritime chokepoints where disruptions could impact global trade:

| Chokepoint | Strategic Importance |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Strait of Hormuz** | 20% of global oil transits; Iran control |
| **Suez Canal** | Europe-Asia shipping; single point of failure |
| **Strait of Malacca** | Primary Asia-Pacific oil route |
| **Bab el-Mandeb** | Red Sea access; Yemen/Houthi activity |
| **Panama Canal** | Americas east-west transit |
| **Taiwan Strait** | Semiconductor supply chain; PLA activity |
| **South China Sea** | Contested waters; island disputes |
| **Black Sea** | Ukraine grain exports; Russian naval activity |

### Density Analysis

Vessel positions are aggregated into a 2° grid to calculate traffic density. Each cell tracks:
- Current vessel count
- Historical baseline (30-minute rolling window)
- Change percentage from baseline

Density changes of ±30% trigger alerts, indicating potential congestion, diversions, or blockades.

### Dark Ship Detection

The system monitors for AIS gaps—vessels that stop transmitting their position. An AIS gap exceeding 60 minutes in monitored regions may indicate:
- Sanctions evasion (ship-to-ship transfers)
- Illegal fishing
- Military activity
- Equipment failure

Vessels reappearing after gaps are flagged for the duration of the session.

### WebSocket Architecture

AIS data flows through a WebSocket relay for real-time updates without polling:

```
AISStream → WebSocket Relay → Browser
              (ws://relay)
```

The connection automatically reconnects on disconnection with a 30-second backoff. When the Ships layer is disabled, the WebSocket disconnects to conserve resources.

---

## Military Tracking

The Military layer provides specialized tracking of military vessels and aircraft, identifying assets by their transponder characteristics and monitoring activity patterns.

### Military Vessel Identification

Vessels are identified as military through multiple methods:

**MMSI Analysis**: Maritime Mobile Service Identity numbers encode the vessel's flag state. The system maintains a mapping of 150+ country codes to identify naval vessels:

| MID Range | Country | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| 338-339 | USA | US Navy, Coast Guard |
| 273 | Russia | Russian Navy |
| 412-414 | China | PLAN vessels |
| 232-235 | UK | Royal Navy |
| 226-228 | France | Marine Nationale |

**Callsign Patterns**: Known military callsign prefixes (NAVY, GUARD, etc.) provide secondary identification.

### Naval Chokepoint Monitoring

The system monitors 12 critical maritime chokepoints with configurable detection radii:

| Chokepoint | Strategic Significance |
|------------|----------------------|
| Strait of Hormuz | Persian Gulf access, oil transit |
| Suez Canal | Mediterranean-Red Sea link |
| Strait of Malacca | Pacific-Indian Ocean route |
| Taiwan Strait | Cross-strait tensions |
| Bosphorus | Black Sea access |
| GIUK Gap | North Atlantic submarine route |

When military vessels enter these zones, proximity alerts are generated.

### Naval Base Proximity

Activity near 12 major naval installations is tracked:

- **Norfolk** (USA) - Atlantic Fleet headquarters
- **Pearl Harbor** (USA) - Pacific Fleet base
- **Sevastopol** (Russia) - Black Sea Fleet
- **Qingdao** (China) - North Sea Fleet
- **Yokosuka** (Japan) - US 7th Fleet

Vessels within 50km of these bases are flagged, enabling detection of unusual activity patterns.

### Aircraft Tracking (OpenSky)

Military aircraft are tracked via the OpenSky Network using ADS-B data:

**Identification Methods**:
- **Callsign matching**: Known military callsign patterns (RCH, REACH, DUKE, etc.)
- **ICAO hex ranges**: Military aircraft use assigned hex code blocks by country
- **Altitude/speed profiles**: Unusual flight characteristics

**Tracked Metrics**:
- Position history (20-point trails over 5-minute windows)
- Altitude and ground speed
- Heading and track

**Activity Detection**:
- Formations (multiple military aircraft in proximity)
- Unusual patterns (holding, reconnaissance orbits)
- Chokepoint transits

### Vessel Position History

The system maintains position trails for tracked vessels:

- **30-point history** per MMSI
- **10-minute cleanup interval** for stale data
- **Trail visualization** on map for recent movement

This enables detection of loitering, circling, or other anomalous behavior patterns.

---

## Social Unrest Tracking

The Protests layer aggregates civil unrest data from two independent sources, providing corroboration and global coverage.

### ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data)

Academic-grade conflict data with human-verified events:
- **Coverage**: Global, 30-day rolling window
- **Event types**: Protests, riots, strikes, demonstrations
- **Metadata**: Actors involved, fatalities, detailed notes
- **Confidence**: High (human-curated)

### GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone)

Real-time news-derived event data:
- **Coverage**: Global, 7-day rolling window
- **Event types**: Geocoded protest mentions from news
- **Volume**: Reports per location (signal strength)
- **Confidence**: Medium (algorithmic extraction)

### Multi-Source Corroboration

Events from both sources are deduplicated using a 0.5° spatial grid and date matching. When both ACLED and GDELT report events in the same area:
- Confidence is elevated to "high"
- ACLED data takes precedence (higher accuracy)
- Source list shows corroboration

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **High** | Fatalities reported, riots, or clashes |
| **Medium** | Large demonstrations, strikes |
| **Low** | Smaller protests, localized events |

Events near intelligence hotspots are cross-referenced to provide geopolitical context.

---

## Aviation Monitoring

The Flights layer tracks airport delays and ground stops at major US airports using FAA NASSTATUS data.

### Delay Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Ground Stop** | No departures permitted; severe disruption |
| **Ground Delay** | Departures held; arrival rate limiting |
| **Arrival Delay** | Inbound traffic backed up |
| **Departure Delay** | Outbound traffic delayed |

### Severity Thresholds

| Severity | Average Delay | Visual |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Severe** | ≥60 minutes | Red |
| **Major** | 45-59 minutes | Orange |
| **Moderate** | 25-44 minutes | Yellow |
| **Minor** | 15-24 minutes | Gray |

### Monitored Airports

The 30 largest US airports are tracked:
- Major hubs: JFK, LAX, ORD, ATL, DFW, DEN, SFO
- International gateways with high traffic volume
- Airports frequently affected by weather or congestion

Ground stops are particularly significant—they indicate severe disruption (weather, security, or infrastructure failure) and can cascade across the network.

---

## Security & Input Validation

The dashboard handles untrusted data from dozens of external sources. Defense-in-depth measures prevent injection attacks and API abuse.

### XSS Prevention

All user-visible content is sanitized before DOM insertion:

```typescript
escapeHtml(str)  // Encodes & < > " ' as HTML entities
sanitizeUrl(url) // Allows only http/https protocols
```

This applies to:
- News headlines and sources (RSS feeds)
- Search results and highlights
- Monitor keywords (user input)
- Map popup content
- Tension pair labels

The `<mark>` highlighting in search escapes text *before* wrapping matches, preventing injection via crafted search queries.

### Proxy Endpoint Validation

Serverless proxy functions validate and clamp all parameters:

| Endpoint | Validation |
|----------|------------|
| `/api/yahoo-finance` | Symbol format `[A-Za-z0-9.^=-]`, max 20 chars |
| `/api/coingecko` | Coin IDs alphanumeric+hyphen, max 20 IDs |
| `/api/polymarket` | Order field allowlist, limit clamped 1-100 |

This prevents upstream API abuse and rate limit exhaustion from malformed requests.

### Content Security

- URLs are validated via `URL()` constructor—only `http:` and `https:` protocols are permitted
- External links use `rel="noopener"` to prevent reverse tabnapping
- No inline scripts or `eval()`—all code is bundled at build time

---

## Fault Tolerance

External APIs are unreliable. Rate limits, outages, and network errors are inevitable. The system implements **circuit breaker** patterns to maintain availability.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

Each external service is wrapped in a circuit breaker that tracks failures:

```
Normal → Failure #1 → Failure #2 → OPEN (cooldown)
                                      ↓
                              5 minutes pass
                                      ↓
                                   CLOSED
```

**Behavior during cooldown:**
- New requests return cached data (if available)
- UI shows "temporarily unavailable" status
- No API calls are made (prevents hammering)

### Protected Services

| Service | Cooldown | Cache TTL |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Yahoo Finance | 5 min | 10 min |
| Polymarket | 5 min | 10 min |
| USGS Earthquakes | 5 min | 10 min |
| NWS Weather | 5 min | 10 min |
| FRED Economic | 5 min | 10 min |
| Cloudflare Radar | 5 min | 10 min |
| ACLED | 5 min | 10 min |
| GDELT | 5 min | 10 min |
| FAA Status | 5 min | 5 min |
| RSS Feeds | 5 min per feed | 10 min |

RSS feeds use per-feed circuit breakers—one failing feed doesn't affect others.

### Graceful Degradation

When a service enters cooldown:
1. Cached data continues to display (stale but available)
2. Status panel shows service health
3. Automatic recovery when cooldown expires
4. No user intervention required

---

## Conditional Data Loading

API calls are expensive. The system only fetches data for **enabled layers**, reducing unnecessary network traffic and rate limit consumption.

### Layer-Aware Loading

When a layer is toggled OFF:
- No API calls for that data source
- No refresh interval scheduled
- WebSocket connections closed (for AIS)

When a layer is toggled ON:
- Data is fetched immediately
- Refresh interval begins
- Loading indicator shown on toggle button

### Unconfigured Services

Some data sources require API keys (AIS relay, Cloudflare Radar). If credentials are not configured:
- The layer toggle is hidden entirely
- No failed requests pollute the console
- Users see only functional layers

This prevents confusion when deploying without full API access.

---

## Performance Optimizations

The dashboard processes thousands of data points in real-time. Several techniques keep the UI responsive even with heavy data loads.

### Web Worker for Analysis

CPU-intensive operations run in a dedicated Web Worker to avoid blocking the main thread:

| Operation | Complexity | Worker? |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| News clustering (Jaccard) | O(n²) | ✅ Yes |
| Correlation detection | O(n × m) | ✅ Yes |
| DOM rendering | O(n) | ❌ Main thread |

The worker manager implements:
- **Lazy initialization**: Worker spawns on first use
- **10-second ready timeout**: Rejects if worker fails to initialize
- **30-second request timeout**: Prevents hanging on stuck operations
- **Automatic cleanup**: Terminates worker on fatal errors

### Virtual Scrolling

Large lists (100+ news items) use virtualized rendering:

**Fixed-Height Mode** (VirtualList):
- Only renders items visible in viewport + 3-item overscan buffer
- Element pooling—reuses DOM nodes rather than creating new ones
- Invisible spacers maintain scroll position without rendering all items

**Variable-Height Mode** (WindowedList):
- Chunk-based rendering (10 items per chunk)
- Renders chunks on-scroll with 1-chunk buffer
- CSS containment for performance isolation

This reduces DOM node count from thousands to ~30, dramatically improving scroll performance.

### Request Deduplication

Identical requests within a short window are deduplicated:
- Market quotes batch multiple symbols into single API call
- Concurrent layer toggles don't spawn duplicate fetches
- `Promise.allSettled` ensures one failing request doesn't block others

### Efficient Data Updates

When refreshing data:
- **Incremental updates**: Only changed items trigger re-renders
- **Stale-while-revalidate**: Old data displays while fetch completes
- **Delta compression**: Baselines store 7-day/30-day deltas, not raw history

---

## Prediction Market Filtering

The Prediction Markets panel focuses on **geopolitically relevant** markets, filtering out sports and entertainment.

### Inclusion Keywords

Markets matching these topics are displayed:
- **Conflicts**: war, military, invasion, ceasefire, NATO, nuclear
- **Countries**: Russia, Ukraine, China, Taiwan, Iran, Israel, Gaza
- **Leaders**: Putin, Zelensky, Trump, Biden, Xi Jinping, Netanyahu
- **Economics**: Fed, interest rate, inflation, recession, tariffs, sanctions
- **Global**: UN, EU, treaties, summits, coups, refugees

### Exclusion Keywords

Markets matching these are filtered out:
- **Sports**: NBA, NFL, FIFA, World Cup, championships, playoffs
- **Entertainment**: Oscars, movies, celebrities, TikTok, streaming

This ensures the panel shows markets like "Will Russia withdraw from Ukraine?" rather than "Will the Lakers win the championship?"

| AISStream | Live vessel positions | Yes (relay) |
| OpenSky Network | Military aircraft tracking | Yes (free) |
| PizzINT | Pentagon-area activity metrics | No |

### Optional API Keys

Some features require API credentials. Without them, the corresponding layer is hidden:

| Variable | Service | How to Get |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `FINNHUB_API_KEY` | Stock quotes (primary) | Free registration at [finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io/) |
| `VITE_WS_RELAY_URL` | AIS vessel tracking | Deploy AIS relay or use hosted service |
| `VITE_OPENSKY_RELAY_URL` | Military aircraft | Deploy OpenSky relay (rate limit bypass) |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Internet outages | Free Cloudflare account with Radar access |
| `ACLED_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Protest data (server-side) | Free registration at acleddata.com |

The dashboard functions fully without these keys—affected layers simply don't appear. Core functionality (news, markets, earthquakes, weather) requires no configuration.

## Design Philosophy

**Information density over aesthetics.** Every pixel should convey signal. The dark interface minimizes eye strain during extended monitoring sessions.

**Authority matters.** Not all sources are equal. Wire services and official government channels are prioritized over aggregators and blogs.

**Correlation over accumulation.** Raw news feeds are noise. The value is in clustering related stories, detecting velocity changes, and identifying cross-source patterns.

**Local-first.** No accounts, no cloud sync. All preferences and history stored locally. The only network traffic is fetching public data.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or suggesting ideas, your help makes this project better.

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/worldmonitor.git
   cd worldmonitor
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Code Style & Conventions

This project follows specific patterns to maintain consistency:

**TypeScript**
- Strict type checking enabled—avoid `any` where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures, types for unions
- Prefer `const` over `let`, never use `var`

**Architecture**
- Services (`src/services/`) handle data fetching and business logic
- Components (`src/components/`) handle UI rendering
- Config (`src/config/`) contains static data and constants
- Utils (`src/utils/`) contain shared helper functions

**Security**
- Always use `escapeHtml()` when rendering user-controlled or external data
- Use `sanitizeUrl()` for any URLs from external sources
- Validate and clamp parameters in API proxy endpoints

**Performance**
- Expensive computations should run in the Web Worker
- Use virtual scrolling for lists with 50+ items
- Implement circuit breakers for external API calls

**No Comments Policy**
- Code should be self-documenting through clear naming
- Only add comments for non-obvious algorithms or workarounds
- Never commit commented-out code

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Ensure your code builds**:
   ```bash
   npm run build

### Development Tips

**Adding a New Data Layer**

1. Create service in `src/services/` for data fetching
2. Add layer toggle in `src/components/Map.ts`
3. Add rendering logic for map markers/overlays
4. Add to help panel documentation
5. Update README with layer description

**Adding a New API Proxy**

1. Create handler in `api/` directory
2. Implement input validation (see existing proxies)
3. Add appropriate cache headers
4. Document any required environment variables

**Debugging**

- Browser DevTools → Network tab for API issues
- Console logs prefixed with `[ServiceName]` for easy filtering
- Circuit breaker status visible in browser console
